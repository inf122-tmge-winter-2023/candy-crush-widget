## About

This is a sample game that is built on top of the `tilematch_tools` package. It emulate a simplified version of the game [Candy Crush]() This game is compatible to run using the built-in game engine.

## Game Rules

- Candy tiles completely fill the board, create three of a kind matches by selecting two tiles to swap
- Matching tiles are removed causing all other tiles to collapse to the bottom of their descent file
- Removed tiles are regenerated by falling from the top. Any further matches created are also removed
- There are a limited number of moves, the game ends when the player runs out of moves

## Adaptations
- Tile swaps do not have range and can be swapped across the board
